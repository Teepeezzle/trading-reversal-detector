# PROJECT_STATE — Short-Horizon Signal Research

> Read this file first every session. Resume from "Next", state a 3-line plan, then work.

**Mission:** rules-based, out-of-sample-validated, cost-aware signal system for
INTRADAY (open→same-session close) and SHORT SWING (≤5 trading days) across
Forex, Metals (XAU/XAG), Oil (WTI/Brent), and Crypto (BTC/ETH/liquid alts).
Success = documented edge net of costs + a daily top-5 actionable list.

**Current phase:** PHASE 1 — Data foundation (kickoff). Phase 0 (setup) done.

---

## Decisions locked (see DECISIONS.md)
- **Data layer (off-peak):** Twelve Data free API (portable, runs in Actions) as primary;
  yfinance as a free cross-check. Free limits: **8 req/min, 800 req/day** — hard-enforced.
- **Repo:** this repo (`trading-reversal-detector`), all research under `research/`,
  work lands via `research/*` branch → PR → user merges. **Never push to main.**
- **Budget:** **$0 — free tiers only.** Fail loudly + log to BLOCKERS.md before exceeding.

## Honest feasibility verdict (see DATA_MANIFEST.md)
- **5m deep history:** not achievable on free tiers → **5m is out of scope** for now
  (Twelve Data free 5min history is shallow; revisit only if budget changes).
- **Survivorship-free universe:** not available free → documented **known limitation**;
  universe = currently-listed liquid instruments only.
- **Working timeframes:** 15m, 1h, 4h, 1D. Intraday depth is the binding constraint.
- **Data ≠ broker feed:** Twelve Data/yfinance ≠ OANDA fills — all costs modelled, and
  live/forward reconciliation against the user's own charts stays mandatory.

---

## Done (Phase 0 → 1 kickoff)
- Architecture defined (3 planes: repo state / Actions off-peak / interactive MCP). See README.md.
- Persistent-state files created: PROJECT_STATE, DECISIONS, BLOCKERS, DATA_MANIFEST,
  HYPOTHESIS_REGISTRY.csv, CANDIDATES, QUEUE, DAILY_SIGNALS.
- Portable data layer written: `research/src/twelvedata_client.py` (rate+budget limited),
  `research/jobs/data_refresh.py` (idempotent lake builder), `research/config.yaml` (universe).
- Off-peak workflow written: `.github/workflows/research-data-refresh.yml` (session-aware).

## Blocked (see BLOCKERS.md) — needs user action before data can flow
1. **TWELVEDATA_API_KEY** must be created (free) and added as a GitHub **Secret**.
2. **Merge this PR to main** — scheduled workflows only run from the default branch.

## Next (Phase 1, once unblocked)
1. First `data_refresh` run → build `/research/data` lake, record real coverage + exact
   Twelve Data symbol strings in DATA_MANIFEST.md.
2. Reconcile a sample (e.g. EUR/USD 1h, BTC/USD 1h) Twelve Data vs yfinance; record tolerance.
3. Then PHASE 2 — indicator survey into HYPOTHESIS_REGISTRY (portable functions only).

## Open questions
- Exact Twelve Data symbols for WTI/Brent on the free plan (verify on first pull).
- How deep is Twelve Data free 15m/1h history in practice? (measure, record).
- Crypto alt universe + any delisting handling we can approximate.
